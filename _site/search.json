To get up and running you need to include the MathJax script in the header of your github pages page, and then write some maths. For LaTex, there are two delimiters you need to know about, one for block or displayed mathematics <code class="highlighter-rouge">\[ ... \]</code>, and the other for inline mathematics <code class="highlighter-rouge">\( ... \)</code>.</p>
